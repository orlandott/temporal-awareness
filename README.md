Research on detecting and steering temporal awareness in LLMs.

## Overview

This project investigates how LLMs encode temporal reasoning and whether we can:
1. **Detect** temporal preference from internal representations
2. **Steer** temporal orientation via activation engineering
3. **Measure** divergence between stated and internal time horizons

**Key findings:**
- GPT-2 encodes temporal scope with 92.5% linear separability
- Steering validation: r=0.935 correlation between steering and probe predictions
- Late layers (6-11) encode semantic temporal features robust to keyword removal

## Contribute — an Open Safety Project

This is an **Open Safety Project**: built so people **new to AI safety** can make real
contributions with a low barrier to entry. No PhD, GPU, or interpretability background
required to start.

## Framework

We ground temporal awareness in **intertemporal preference**:

```
U(o_i; θ) = u(r_i) · D(t_i; θ)     # Value function
t_internal = inf{t : D(t) ≤ α}     # Internal horizon
```

**Key questions:**
- Does `t_internal ≈ t_h` (stated horizon)?
- Can we detect divergence between stated and internal preference?

See [docs/research_plan.md](docs/research_plan.md) for full framework.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env  # Add API keys
```

For the EAP-IG workflow, install the pinned extra dependency:

```bash
pip install -e ".[eap_ig]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from latents import SteeringFramework
from latents.model_adapter import get_model_config

# Use latents library for extraction and steering
```

```bash
# Train probes
python scripts/probes/train_temporal_probes_caa.py
```

## Q&A EAP-IG Workflow

After installing the EAP-IG extra with `pip install -e ".[eap_ig]"`, the full Q&A EAP-IG pipeline can be run from one CLI command:

```bash
temporal-awareness-eap-ig-workflow --top-n 500
```

Equivalent repo-local entrypoint:

```bash
python scripts/experiments/eap_ig/run_eap_ig_workflow.py --top-n 500
```

Useful options:
- `--no-save-to-hf` keeps the workflow fully local.
- `--start-at top-components --stop-after visualize` reuses existing EAP-IG outputs.
- `--top-n 200` or `--top-n 1000` reproduces the alternate node-selection variants.
